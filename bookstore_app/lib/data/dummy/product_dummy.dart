    <p class="dcr-4iq4cq"><span class="dcr-1i2w9iu"><span class="dcr-1jnp7wy">I</span></span><span class="dcr-4iq4cq">’ve been enamoured of prose fiction for quite a long while,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Alan Moore</a>. He is speaking to me from his home in Northampton for the launch of Illuminations, a short story collection – and, at the age of 68, his first. “But when I started my professional career, it tended to take a bit of a back seat because there were other things going on.” “Other things”, for those who don’t know Moore’s work, is his gracefully understated shorthand for a 40-year career in the funny papers that made him probably the most respected comics writer on the planet.</span></p>
    <p class="dcr-4iq4cq">Yet he has always had literary roots: his best-known work, Watchmen,<em> </em>took its title from Juvenal, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen<em> </em>was peopled by the canonical characters of 19th-century adventure stories. So, although Moore avowedly dislikes nostalgia, short fiction is a sort of coming home – back to the library he joined at the age of five and, once he’d outgrown Enid Blyton and Just William, where he got his teeth into science fiction and fantasy.</p>
